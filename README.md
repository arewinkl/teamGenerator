## Description
For this homework assignment we were tasked with using node.js and *testing functions* to generate a **team home page** file. This HTML file then would need to appear alongside all of the other JavaScript files that we had previously created. For this to occur we would need to use the command line to create the *team page*. An array of questions needs to be made so that the user can follow the prompts provided to then and fill in all the necessary information to create the employee cards with __data & info__. Functions had to be generated so that they can be called on to not only write the file but to also provide the correct questions depending on what position the employee that was being added was. Make sure that all the pages can interact so that they can __pull and push__ information to and from each other. Styling of the page was required as well, so a css page would need to be attached along with the newly created html file.

## Installation

In order to get this __Team Generator__ to work, the first task was to download and install all of the necessary programming information. This meant loading all of the necessary __npm__ and __node.js__ add ons. This was extremely easy especially since we went over ane practiced thus several times during class this week. Each of the packages installed in very little time and with the addition of the __.gitignore__ file, everything was ready for this assignment.

## challenges

This assignment came with quite a few challenges, and the first one that I encountered was going through the __testing js files__. Going back between the testing files and the actual javascript files took some time to get used too, especially with the console open so that I could make sure all the functions would be able to pass the tests that were already built. Once I was able to get all of the return statements in the correct place, I was able to pass all of the necessary tests to start building out the array for questions. The next problem that I encountered was writing out a __question array__ that would answer all of the necessary fields for the assignment. This was a challenge at first because I wasn't sure that I could have the arrays all in one or if it had to go off of one array and then modify the one differing question based on the position. I was able to address this problem by making a different array for each position, this was the most *obvious* solution, and in the end was the best choice. The third and final challenge that I encountered was messing with getting all of the questions to *pop up* when you switch between options in the employee array. This only became a problem since some of my functions that I had called above weren't __pushing__ their information.
